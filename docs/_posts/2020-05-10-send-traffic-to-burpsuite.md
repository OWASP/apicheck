title: "Sending traffic to BurpSuite"
---

In the [previous post](https://bbva.github.io/apicheck/2020/05/08/save-navigation-sessions.html) post we talked about how to store navigation traffic in a session file. Now we'll use this file to send it to a proxy, like BurpSuite or ZAP proxy.

As part of `APICheck tool set` there's available the [Send-to-proxy](https://bbva.github.io/apicheck/tools/apicheck/send-to-proxy) tool. This tool reads from `stdin` and sends each [APICheck Data Objects](https://bbva.github.io/apicheck/docs/integrating-new-tools#apicheck-data-format) to a proxy.

Weâ€™ll use the session file that we generated in previous post to send it to [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net):

First we check the BurpSuite listen port:

Second, we'll install the `send-to-proxy` tool:

```bash
acp install send-to-proxy
```

Then, we send the session to the proxy:

```console
$ cat sessions.data | send-to-proxy http://127.0.0.1:9000
[*] Request sent: 'https://cr0hn.com:443/'
[*] Request sent: 'https://cr0hn.com:443/wp-includes/css/dist/block-library/style.min.css'
[*] Request sent: 'https://cr0hn.com:443/wp-includes/css/dist/block-library/theme.min.css'
[*] Request sent: 'https://cr0hn.com:443/wp-content/plugins/card-elements-for-elementor/assets/css/common-card-style.css'
[*] Request sent: 'https://cr0hn.com:443/wp-content/plugins/card-elements-for-elementor/assets/css/testimonial-card-style.css'
...
``` 

Now we check that all the requests were received by the proxy:
